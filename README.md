  **INTRODUCTION AND PRESENTATION OF BUSINESS**
  
The case study for this project presents a sports company that operates a website dedicated to providing in-depth NBA data and statistics to its audience. The company's goal is to offer valuable insights into team and player performances, which can help website visitors and league bettors make well-founded decisions. The company aspires to boost user engagement and draw a wider audience to its platform.

Apart from providing data to website users, the company's employees also need efficient access to this information to perform their daily tasks. To achieve these objectives, the company has partnered with our team to develop an end-to-end self-service BI solution that will provide easy and efficient access to the NBA data of interest to both website users and company employees, supporting their respective decisions.

This solution will consist of an engaging dashboard that focuses on various aspects of NBA games, such as team and player stats, match official records, and historical performance trends, and that will generate accurate reports that answer the questions of each target user. The dashboard will cater to the requirements of both gambler users and company employees by presenting the data in an easy-to-understand and visually attractive way. Additionally, the implementation of row-level security in Power BI will ensure the confidentiality of the data. Filters restrict data access at the row level, and you can define filters within roles.

Ultimately, the Power BI solution will improve the decision-making process and overall experience of both gambler users and company employees on the website.
